# Count Perfect Squares

![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Basic-red)

## Problem

Given a positive integer  **n**, find the number of perfect squares that are less than  **n**  in the sample space of perfect squares. The sample space consists of all perfect squares starting from 1 (i.e., 1, 4, 9, 16, 25, …)

 **Examples :** 

```
Input: n = 9
Output: 2
Explanation: 1 and 4 are the only Perfect Squares less than 9. So, the Output is 2.
```

```
Input: n = 3
Output: 1
Explanation: 1 is the only Perfect Square less than 3. So, the Output is 1.
```

 **Constraints:** 
1 <= n <= 108

class Solution {
  public:
    int countSquares(int n) {
        int count = 0;
        for(int i=1; i*i<n; i++){
            count++;
        }
        return count;
    }
};
```
